# AlgoVisualization
This is a webapp build using JavaScript that visualizes 2 algorithms to get a Minimum Spanning Tree for the users: Prim's algorithm & Kruskal's algorithm. 
For Prims's algorithm , this webapp is built using a custom Priority Queue to maintain the visited nodes. 
For Kruskal's algorithm, we are using Breadth First Search to detect cycles in the newly built minimum spanning tree.
